# Orchiectomies and body image

Learnt this bit after watching a Mad Men episode.

> In cisgender men, the loss of one or both testicles from orchiectomy can have severe implications in identity and self-image surrounding masculinity, such that it can lead to thoughts of hopelessness, inadequacy, and loss. Among male testicular cancer survivors who have lost a testicle, there are feelings of shame and loss, which are more evident in young and single men than older and non-single men.[13] As many as one third of men who will undergo orchiectomy are not offered the option of having a testicular prosthesis. Data shows that simply offering testicular prosthesis to men undergoing orchioectomy is psychologically beneficial. While some men do not mind losing a testicle, studies have shown that there is a change in body image in testicular cancer survivors who have undergone orchiectomy and an improvement in body image in 50â€“60% of individuals who undergo testicular prosthesis placement. One year after testicular prosthesis placement, there are reports of increase in self-esteem and psychological well-being during sexual activity in a study that followed up on post-orchiectomy individuals including adolescents.[14] On the other hand, there is a current debate whether children undergoing orchiectomy should be offered testicular prosthesis to be inserted at the time of orchiectomy procedure.[5][15]
